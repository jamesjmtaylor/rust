# Rust

A repository to store my work as I learn Rust

## Cargo

The initial state of this project can be recreated by executing `cargo new [projectName]` from the terminal.

* To build: `cargo build`
* To build & run: `cargo run`
* To do a compile check (but not build an executable): `cargo check`
* To build an optimized executable: `cargo build --release`
* To update dependencies: `cargo update`
* To generate dependency documentation: `cargo doc --open`
